The Findutils package contains programs to find files. Programs
are provided to search through all the files in a directory
tree and to create, maintain, and search a database (often
faster than the recursive find, but unreliable unless the
database has been updated recently). Findutils also supplies
the xargs program, which can be used to run a specified command
on each file selected by a search.
