The Libffi library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions. This allows a
programmer to call any function specified by a call interface
description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. An FFI allows a
program written in one language to call a program written in
another language. Specifically, Libffi can provide a bridge
between an interpreter like Perl, or Python, and shared library
subroutines written in C, or C++.
